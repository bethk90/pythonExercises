"""The Goal: The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs.
For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc.
Then, once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into
a premade story template. Youâ€™ll need prompts for user input,
and to then print out the full story at the end with the input included."""
